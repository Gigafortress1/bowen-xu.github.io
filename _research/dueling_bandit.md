The following are the main work of this project:

* [Review slides for Dueling Bandit algorithms](https://xubowen0816.github.io/bowen-xu.github.io/research/file/dueling bandit review/dueling_bandit review.pdf).
* [Review slides for Self-Sparring algorithm](https://xubowen0816.github.io/bowen-xu.github.io/research/file/dueling bandit review/self-sparring algorithm.pdf.pdf).
* [Mindmap for Dueling Bandit algorithm review](https://xubowen0816.github.io/bowen-xu.github.io/research/file/dueling bandit review/mindmap dueling bandit.pdf).

In this research topic, I conducted a detailed investigation on the existing dueling bandit algorithms, summarized several representative algorithms among them, and based on different problem settings, different motivations and application scenarios and other standards to These algorithms are compared and classified, and the development of the dueling bandit algorithm and the key problems to be solved in the future are analyzed.

For example, if different application scenarios (problem conditions) are used as classification criteria, then there are the following representative algorithms in corresponding scenarios:

* IF(Interleaved Filter, 2009): strong stochastic transitivity (SST).
* BTM (2011): relaxed stochastic transitivity (RST)

If different algorithm design bases are used as classification criteria, For example, if different algorithm design bases are used as classification criteria, it can be divided into the following typical algorithms:

* RUCB (2014): Apply UCB in relative setting (by upper bound)
* RMED (2015): Minimum Empirical Divergence
* DTS (2016): Extends the Thompson Sampling in relative setting to apply dueling bandit

If you need to solve the problem in the dependent arm scenario, there are the following typical algorithms:

* Self-Sparring (2017): Solve Dueling Bandit problem with dependent arms

The purpose and work of this review is to make a detailed classification and summary of the existing dueling bandit, divide them into several categories through the above method, and look forward to their respective future challenges and development directions, etc.
