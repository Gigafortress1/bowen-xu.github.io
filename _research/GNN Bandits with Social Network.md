**Key words:** Bandits Algorithm, GNN (Graph Neural Network), Constrained Setting, Social Network.

My main work in this project are:

* Design a **constrained** GNN (Graph Neural Network) bandit algorithm with social network.
* Design a GNN (Graph Neural Network) bandit algorithm with **dependent arms** applied in social network.
