**Key words:** Deep Reinforcement Learning, AI for Science, AlphaTensor, AlphaGo.

This is one significant part of ShanghaiTech University 'AI for Science' Project.

Some implementations of DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) models. include:

* AlphaTensor (Accelerate Tensors/Matrices Computation).
* AlphaGo.

In this project, my main tasks are:

* Build GPU clusters and large neural networks.
* Reproduce the effect of AlphaTensor and AlphaGo.
* Promote DRL-based interdisciplinary projects ( AI for Science ) .

In the future, we plan to implement DRL techniques in the application scenarios as below:

* DRL for nuclear fusion.
* DRL for protein synthesis.
