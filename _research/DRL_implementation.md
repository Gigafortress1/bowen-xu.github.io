**Key words:** Deep Reinforcement Learning, AlphaTensor, AlphaGo.

Some implementations of DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) models. include:

* AlphaTensor (Accelerate Tensors/Matrices Computation)
* AlphaGo

In this project, my main tasks are:

* Build GPU clusters and large neural networks.
* Reproduce the effect of AlphaTensor and AlphaGo.
