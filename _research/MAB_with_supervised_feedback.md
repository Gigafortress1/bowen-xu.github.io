In this project, I developed a model for online learning that **integrates both bandit feedback and supervised feedback**. This approach enables the model to better adapt to real-world scenarios. Specifically, I applied this model to **simulate federated distillation** and obtained promising results.

This project is expected to be submitted as a research paper.
