**Key words:** Bandit Learning, Supervised Feedback, Federated Distillation, Distributed AI Systems.

In this project, I developed an innovative Multi-Arm Bandit(MAB) model that **integrates both bandit feedback and supervised feedback**. This approach enables the model to better adapt to real-world scenarios. Specifically, I applied this model to **simulate federated distillation** and obtained promising results.
