**Key words:** Transformer model, Review.

The following are the main work of this project:

* [Transformer Model Details](https://xubowen0816.github.io/bowen-xu.github.io/research/file/transformer/transformer model details.pdf)

In this project, I mainly completed the research on **Transformer model** and its derived BERT model, which have great influence in recent years and are widely used in CV and NLP fields. The **Background, Motivation, idea, Attention Mechanism and Architecture of Transformer model** are summarized in detail, and Transformer model is **compared with traditional CNN, RNN, LSTM** and other models according to different structures and uses. It reflects the advantages of transformer compared with the traditional model.

After summarizing the transformer model, I also introduced its derivative model **BERT model**, including its **Idea, Architecture and its Improvements** compared to the transformer model.

In this research on the Transformer model, I think I have the following two aspects of improvement:

1. I have studied the Transformer model in detail, which has a great influence on the future work related to CV and NLP.
2. I trained my skills in making slides, and I learned how to explain a model from the shallower to the deeper, and how to make vivid and easy-to-understand animations to make slides more acceptable to the audience.
