<!-- **Key words:** Bandit Learning, Supervised Feedback, Federated Distillation, Distributed AI Systems.

In this project, I developed an innovative Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) model that **integrates both bandit feedback and supervised feedback**. This approach enables the model to better adapt to real-world scenarios. Specifically, I applied this model to **simulate federated distillation** and obtained promising results. -->

Design an innovative algorithm framework combined with online feedback (in particular, bandit feedback) and supervised learning feedback, applied in federated distillation with constraints.
