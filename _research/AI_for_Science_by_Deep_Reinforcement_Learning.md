**Key words:** Deep Reinforcement Learning, AI for Science, AlphaGo.

This is one significant part of ShanghaiTech University 'AI for Science' Project.

Some application of DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning) models. include:

* AlphaGo (Present).
* AlphaTensor (Plan): To Accelerate Tensors / Matrices Computation.

In this project, my main work in the present are:

* Reproduce the project AlphaGo (in process).
* Introduce deep reinforcement learning to researchers of basic science (e.g. life science and physics) (in process).

In the future, we plan to implement DRL techniques in the application scenarios as below:

* DRL for nuclear fusion.
* DRL for protein design.
