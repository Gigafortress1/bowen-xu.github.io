I am a senior student studying at [School of Information and Science](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/).

I am now a Computer Science Bachelor's candidate at the [Intelligence, Information and Decision (IID) Lab](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/shaozy/lab.html), part of the [Network Intelligence Center (NICE)](https://nice.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), which is housed within the [School of Information Science and Technology (SIST)](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), China. My current advisor is [Prof. Ziyu Shao](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/shaozy/home.html).

My research interest includes Bandits & Reinforcement Learning, Network Intelligence, Federated Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Currently I focused my research on the topics below:

* **Federated AIGC (AI-Generated Content)**: personalized federated learning algorithm framework with online feedback (in particular, bandit feedback) and supervised feedback.
* **Constrained GNN (Graph Neural Network) Bandit**: combining GNN and bandit algorithms to solve graph structure problem, and considering operational constraints like budget and fairness.

In conclusion, my research concentrates on using the **bandit algorithm** to make the **networked systems** applicable to a wider range of real-world scenarios (especially with **constrained setting**).
