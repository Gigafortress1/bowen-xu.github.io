I am a senior student studying at [School of Information and Science](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/).

I am now a Computer Science Bachelor's candidate at the [Intelligence, Information and Decision (IID) Lab](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/shaozy/lab.html), part of the [Network Intelligence Center (NICE)](https://nice.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), which is housed within the [School of Information Science and Technology (SIST)](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), China. My current advisor is [Prof. Ziyu Shao](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/shaozy/home.html).

My research interest includes Bandit & (Deep) Reinforcement Learning, Network Intelligence, Online Learning
and Optimization, Deep Learning with Principled Design, AI for Science.

Currently, I focused my research on the topics below:

* **Constrained Personalized Federated Learning:** personalized federated learning algorithm framework with online feedback (in particular, bandit feedback) and supervised feedback.
* **MaxWeight with Discounted UCB Algorithm:**
* **Constrained GNN (Graph Neural Network) Bandit with Social Network:** combining GNN and bandit algorithms to solve graph structure problem, and considering operational constraints like budget and fairness.

In conclusion, my research concentrates on implementing intelligent decision-making and efficient resource allocation using **Bandit & Reinforcement Learning** and **Online Learning and Optimization** algorithms, with applications in various areas including **Network Intelligence** and Distributed AI System (particularly in resource-constrained scenarios).
Additionally, I am interested in the mathematical interpretability of Deep Learning as well as the application of **Deep Reinforcement Learning** and Graph Neural Networks in AI for Science.
